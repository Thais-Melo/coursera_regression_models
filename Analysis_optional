##An interesting conclusion is that for 3 out of the 4 major categories investigated further, 
#Education, Engineering, Business and Biology & Life Science, because of the high earnings,
#their interations with the percentage of women in these areas were significant and their coefficients
#were negative. Looking at the graphic "h" it's possible to visualize this effect.
#Even though this major categories appear to receive higher earnings, the greater the female participation in the area,
#the lower their gains.

summary(fit7)
#Including other variables doesn't bring much to the model, their coefficients are not significant and the R^2 (and adjusted R^2)
# and the F-statistic are slightly worse.

##The best model was the forth, with the interaction between the percentage of women and the major category
#Some interesting coefficients are significant and the model and its F-statistic is able to reject the null hypothesis that 
#all the coefficients are zero. But still, the effect is minimal, and the model doesn't explain much of the outcome.
#The first model, with only the major categories as regressors indicate that it does not affect the earnings.
